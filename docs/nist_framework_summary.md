### Comprised of:
- CSF Core: A categorization of high-level cybersecurity outcomes that help an organization manage its cybersecurity risks
- CSF Organizational Profiles: A way to describe an organization’s current and target cybersecurity strength level in terms of the CSF Core’s outcomes
- CSF Tiers: These can be used in CSF Organizational Profiles to assess the rigor of an organization’s cybersecurity risk governance and management practices.

- Protect: Safeguarding systems and data to prevent incidents. Includes management, access control, data security, training, and resilience.
- Respond: Covers incident response planning, communication, analysis, mitigation, and improvements. Aims for quicker response to cyber threats
- Recover: Helps organizations restore services and minimize damage after an incident. Includes recovery planning, improvements, and communication strategies.
- Detect: Provides mechanisms to monitor, identify, and detect cybersecurity events. Involves continuous security monitoring, anomaly detection, and event logging.
