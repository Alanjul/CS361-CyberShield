# NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 (CSF 2.0)
Guidance to industry, government agencies, and other organizations to manage and reduce cybersecurity risks. Useful for fostering internal and external communication across teams.
### Comprised of:
- CSF Core: A categorization of high-level cybersecurity outcomes that help an organization manage its cybersecurity risks
- CSF Organizational Profiles: A way to describe an organization’s current and target cybersecurity strength level in terms of the CSF Core’s outcomes
- CSF Tiers: These can be used in CSF Organizational Profiles to assess the rigor of an organization’s cybersecurity risk governance and management practices.
### It consists of six core functions:
- Govern: Establishing cybersecurity policies, roles, responsibilities, and risk processes. Ensuring that cybersecurity is integrated into business strategy
- Identify: Helps organizations understand assets, risks, and vulnerabilities. Covers asset management, business environment, risk assessment, and supply chain risk management.
- Protect: Safeguarding systems and data to prevent incidents. Includes management, access control, data security, training, and resilience.
- Respond: Covers incident response planning, communication, analysis, mitigation, and improvements. Aims for quicker response to cyber threats
- Recover: Helps organizations restore services and minimize damage after an incident. Includes recovery planning, improvements, and communication strategies.
- Detect: Provides mechanisms to monitor, identify, and detect cybersecurity events. Involves continuous security monitoring, anomaly detection, and event logging.

# NIST SP 800-37 Risk Management Framework (RMF)
The Risk Management Framework provides a structured and flexible process for managing organizations' cybersecurity and privacy risks. 
### Seven key steps:
- Prepare: Establish the foundation for risk management by defining roles, strategies, risk assessments, control baselines, and continuous monitoring plans.
- Categorize: Determine the potential impact of security breaches on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data.
- Select: Choose, tailor, and document security controls from NIST SP 800-53 based on risk assessments.
- Implement: Deploy and document the security controls within the system.
- Access: Evaluate whether the implemented controls function correctly and meet security and privacy requirements.
- Authorize: Senior officials review risk analysis and determine whether the system is authorized to operate.
- Monitor: Continuously oversee security controls, reassess risks, and respond to changes in the system and environment.
